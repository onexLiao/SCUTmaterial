## II.简答题(5 points each)

1. In a carry-lookahead adder, each bit-slice of the adder must use inputs a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> and c<sub>i</sub> to produce generate function g<sub>i</sub>, propagate function p<sub>i</sub>, and sum output s<sub>i</sub>. A proposal has been made to replace the standard definition of the propagate function: p<sub>i</sub>=a<sub>i</sub>+b<sub>i</sub> with a version that uses the *exclusive-or* function: p<sub>i</sub>=a<sub>i</sub>b<sub>i</sub>.The carry function is now implemented in the carry-lookahead unit as before: c<sub>i+1</sub>=g<sub>i</sub>+p<sub>i</sub>*c<sub>i</sub>.
(1) Will the modified propagate function work properly in the calculation of carry signals by the carry lookahead unit? Why or why not?
(2) What advantage would there be in using the exclusive-or version of the propagate signal?

## III.综合题（10 points each）

1. Using sequential multiplication algorithm, perform the operations A×B on the 4-bit unsigned numbers A= 1011 and B= 1101\. Write the computation processes in a computer machine.

***Solution:***

2. Consider the two-dimensional array A:
int A[][] = new int[100][100];
Where A[0][0] is at location 200, in a paged memory system with pages of size 200\. A small process is in page 0 (locations 0 to 199) for manipulating the matrix; thus, every instruction fetch will be from page 0.
Suppose that the elements of the array are stored in row order in the virtual memory. For three page frames, how many page faults are generated by the following array-initialization loops, using LRU replacement, and assuming page frame 1 has the process in it, and the other two are initially empty?
(1)	
```
      for (int j = 0; j < 100; j++)		
            for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)	
                A[i][j] = 0;	
```

(2)

          for (int i = 0; i < 100; j++)
                for (int j = 0; j < 100; i++)	
                    A[i][j] = 0;

3. Assume that a computer’s instruction length is 8-bit. Suppose the designers need 3 instructions with two 3-bit operands, 2 instructions with one 4-bit operand and 4 instructions with one 3-bit operand. How should we design the instruction format?

4. A logic circuit is needed to implement the priority network shown like figure below. The network handles three interrupt request lines. When a request is received on line INTRi, the network generates an acknowledgement on line INTAi. If more than one request is received, only the highest-priority request is acknowledged, where the ordering of priority is: priority of INTR1 > priority of INTR2 > priority of INTR3.

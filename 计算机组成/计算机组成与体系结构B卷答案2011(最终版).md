## 二、简答题

#### 1. Solution:

(1) The only difference in pi is that it will not be high when ai and bi are both high. However, in this case ci+1 will be 1 anyway because gi will be 1, so the carry is not affected by the change. Yes, it will work.

(2) The advantage is that pi can now also be used to help compute the sum of each bit (recall si=aibici). This can be a substantial savings for a 32-bit adder.

#### 2. Solution:

 **Write through**: The cache location and the main memory location are updated simultaneously. It can keep cache and main memory consistent at the same time. But all writes require main memory access, and it will slow down the system.

 **Write back**: Update only the cache location and to mark it as updated with a dirty or modified bit. When the block containing the marked word is to be removed from the cache, update the main memory location of the word. It’s faster than write-through, because time is not spent accessing main memory, and writes to multiple words within a block require only one write to the main-memory. But portions of main memory are invalid, and extra bit is needed in cache to indicate which block has been modified.

#### 3. Solution:

The main advantage of hardwired control is fast operation. The disadvantages include: higher cost, inflexibility when changes or additions are to be made, and longer time required to design and implement such units.

Microprogrammed control is characterized by low cost and high flexibility. Lower speed of operation becomes a problem in high-performance computers.

#### 4. Solution:

A subroutine is called by a program instruction to perform a function needed by the calling program.

An interrupt-service routine is initiated by an event such as an input operation or a hardware error. The function it performs may not be at all related to the program being executed at the time of interruption. Hence, it must not affect any of the data or status information relating to that program.

#### 2. Solution:
(1) 50 (2) 5000

#### 3. Solution:
00 aaa bbb
01 aaa bbb
10 aaa bbb
11 - expansion
1100 aaaa
1101 aaaa
1110 - expansion
1111 - expansion
11100 aaa
11101 aaa
11110 aaa
11111 aaa
Conclusion:
00 - 10	 3 instructions
1100 - 1101	2 instructions
11100 - 11111	 4 instructions
